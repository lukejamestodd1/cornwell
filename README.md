### shortcuts and incomplete parts

I spent time learning my way around React and components, and ran out of time to get the map working perfectly and to fix some of the more fiddly and time sapping CSS bugs. As a React noob I finished everything I could in one working day. I really enjoyed this coding challenge!

bugs and things to fix next time:
 - Google Maps API colour scheme: I couldn't work this out in time so set the map to grayscale using CSS. Unfortulately this means the pointer is also in black and white because it is inside the grayscale container. I'd be able to find a fix for this with more time studying the Maps API docs and how to get the custom colour schemes working.
 - Follow us button: I took a shortcut here and used a parallellogram instead of the rhombus, which has skewed the text. This can be fixed with more time to fiddle around with it.
 - Funky spacing: The create-react-app template I used has some really funky vertical spacing included. I found it hard to find where this spacing was coming from. I fixed this using media queries and top margins on the maps div for different screen sizes, and would like to learn a better way to handle this.
