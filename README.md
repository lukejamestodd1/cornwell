## Coding Exercise for Cornwell

### shortcuts and incomplete parts

I spent time learning my way around React and components, and ran out of time to get the map working perfectly and to fix some of the more fiddly and time sapping CSS bugs. As a React noob I finished everything I could in one working day. I really enjoyed this coding challenge!

bugs and things to fix next time:
 - Google Maps API colour scheme: I couldn't work this out in time so set the map to black and white using CSS. Unfortulately this means the pointer is also in black and white. I'd be able to find a fix for this with more time studying the Maps API and how to get the custom colour scheme working. 
 - Follow us button: I took a shortcut here and used a parallellogram instead of the rhombus, which has skewed the text. This can be fixed with more time to fiddle around with it.
 - Instagram pictures: I used my own account to show photos for this exercise. Next time I will show pictures from a different account too.
